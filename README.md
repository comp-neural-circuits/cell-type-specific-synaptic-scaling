Every figure can be generated by simply running the file "main_for_paper.py".

Supplementary figure and some easy function to visualize your simulations can be found in the jupyter notebook 'robustness.ipynb' and 'analytics.ipynb'.

Inside the folder 'data', data from already executed simulations can be found.
